  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: 9/1/25</em></p>

  <p><strong>GearSmith</strong> ("the App") is developed to help users track maintenance on their vehicles. 
  This privacy policy explains how information is collected, used, and protected when using the App.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account or log in, we collect your email address through Firebase Authentication.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Firebase may collect non-identifying information such as device type, operating system, crash logs, and app performance metrics.</li>
    <li><strong>Maintenance Data:</strong> Any information you enter into the App (e.g., vehicle details, maintenance records) is stored securely in Firebase.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To allow you to log in and access your account across devices.</li>
    <li>To sync your data between devices and/or household members.</li>
    <li>To improve app stability and performance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Sharing of Information</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information. We only share data with trusted third-party services (Firebase) that provide hosting, authentication, and database functionality.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>
