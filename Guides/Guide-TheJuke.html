        Welcome! The Juke is a two-part app that connects bands and audiences during live music events.
        Bands can share their setlist in real-time, accept song requests, and collect tips digitally—while
        audiences can follow along with what's coming up, request their favorite songs, and support the band
        without leaving their table.
      </p>

        <h2>🎸 For Bands: Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
          Set up your band profile and start engaging with your audience in minutes:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li><strong>Create your band Username:</strong> Add your band name, logo, and profile links</li>
       <!--   <li><strong>Add band members:</strong> Invite your bandmates and assign roles (lead vocals, guitar, drums, etc.)</li> -->
          <li><strong>Build your song library:</strong> Add all the songs in your repertoire</li>
       <!--    <li><strong>Create your first event:</strong> Set up your venue, date, and time</li>  -->
          <li><strong>Generate your Band code:</strong> Share this with your audience so they can connect</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Set up your song library before your first gig. You can always add more
          songs later, but starting with a solid list makes creating setlists much faster.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="guide-section">
        <h2>🎵 Building Your Setlist</h2>
        <p>
          Create engaging setlists that keep your audience excited:
        </p>
        <h3>Creating a Setlist:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Click "New Setlist" for your event</li>
          <li>Add songs from your library in the order you'll perform them</li>
          <li>Mark breaks between sets (15-minute break, intermission, etc.)</li>
          <li>Reorder songs with drag-and-drop if plans change</li>
          <li>Save and publish to make it visible to your audience</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>During Your Performance:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Add spontaneous songs:</strong> Drop in surprise covers or requests</li>
          <li><strong>Update break times:</strong> Running long? Adjust your break timing in real-time</li>
          <li><strong>Confirm queued songs have been played:</strong> Keep the audience's request queue up to date<li>
        </ul>
        
        </section>

      <section class="guide-section">
        <h2>🎤 Managing Song Requests</h2>
        <p>
          Let your audience request songs while you stay in control:
        </p>
        <h3>Setting Up Requests:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Mark songs in your library as "Requestable" or "Not Requestable"</li>
          <li>Set a maximum number of requests per event (prevent spam)</li>
          <li>Set a tip value for requests (more on that below)</li>
          <li>Optionally require an additional charge to move your request to the top of the queue</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Reviewing Requests:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>View all incoming requests in the requests queue</li>
          <li>See who requested what and when</li>
          <li>Accept requests to add them to your setlist</li>
          <li>Decline requests that don't fit the vibe or timing</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Don't accept every request immediately. Review them during breaks
          and add the ones that fit your planned flow. Your audience will understand—they just want
          to be heard!
        </p>

      <section class="guide-section">
        <h2>💰 Collecting Digital Tips</h2>
        <p>
          Make it easy for your audience to support you financially:
        </p>
        <h3>Setting Up Tips:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Connect your payment method (PayPal, Venmo, Cash App, Stripe, etc.)</li>
          <li>Set suggested tip amounts ($5, $10, $20, custom)</li>
          <li>Enable tips for general support or specific song requests</li>
          <li>Add a thank-you message that appears after tipping</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Tip Features:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Shoutouts:</strong> Optionally display tipper names on the audience screen</li>
          <li><strong>Real-time notifications:</strong> Get alerted when requests and tips come in</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          <strong>Best Practice:</strong> Mention tips and requests a couple times during your show ("Hey folks, if
          you're enjoying the music, there's a tip button in The Juke app!") but don't overdo it.
          Let the music do most of the talking.
