        Welcome! GearSmith helps you track vehicle maintenance, service history, and repairs.
        Whether you're managing one car or an entire household fleet, GearSmith keeps everything
        organized in one place.
      </p>

      <!-- Getting Started -->
      <section class="guide-section">
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
          Start tracking your vehicles in just a few simple steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Add your vehicles:</strong> Enter details like make, model, year, and VIN</li>
          <li><strong>Set up maintenance schedules:</strong> Configure reminders for oil changes, tire rotations, inspections, and more</li>
          <li><strong>Enable reminders:</strong> Get notifications when service is due so you never miss important maintenance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Add all your household vehicles at once, even if they don't need
          service right away. It's easier to have everything in one place from the start.
        </p>

      <!-- Logging Maintenance -->
      <section class="guide-section">
        <h2>Logging Maintenance</h2>
        <p>
          Keep detailed records of every service, repair, and modification:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open the vehicle profile you want to update</li>
          <li>Click "Add Service" or the + button</li>
          <li>Fill in service details:
            <ul>
              <li>Service date</li>
              <li>Service type (oil change, tire rotation, brake service, etc.)</li>
              <li>Cost and mileage</li>
              <li>Service provider/shop name</li>
              <li>Notes about the work performed</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Attach receipts or photos if needed (great for warranty claims!)</li>
          <li>Save the entry</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What to Track:</h3>
        <p>
          Don't limit yourself to just routine maintenance! Consider logging:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Repairs and replacements</li>
          <li>Modifications and upgrades</li>
          <li>Tire changes and rotations</li>
          <li>Fluid top-offs</li>
          <li>Inspections and emissions tests</li>
          <li>Accidents or insurance claims</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Viewing Service History -->
      <section class="guide-section">
        <h2>Viewing Service History</h2>
        <p>
          Access your complete service history anytime:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Open the vehicle profile:</strong> Select the vehicle from your dashboard</li>
          <li><strong>Scroll through service records:</strong> See all entries in chronological order</li>
          <li><strong>Use filters:</strong> Find specific service types, date ranges, or shops quickly</li>
          <li><strong>Export records:</strong> Generate reports for tax purposes, resale, or warranty claims</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Best Practice:</strong> Review your service history before selling a vehicle.
          A complete maintenance log can increase resale value and buyer confidence!
        </p>

      <!-- Setting Up Reminders -->
      <section class="guide-section">
        <h2>Setting Up Maintenance Reminders</h2>
        <p>
          Never miss important maintenance with automatic reminders:
        </p>
        <h3>How to Set Reminders:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to vehicle settings</li>
          <li>Select "Maintenance Schedule"</li>
          <li>Choose service type (oil change, tire rotation, etc.)</li>
          <li>Set reminder frequency:
            <ul>
              <li>By mileage (e.g., every 5,000 miles)</li>
              <li>By time (e.g., every 6 months)</li>
              <li>By both mileage and time</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Enable notifications</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          GearSmith will alert you when service is coming due, giving you time to schedule
          an appointment.

      <!-- Managing Multiple Vehicles -->
      <section class="guide-section">
        <h2>Managing Multiple Vehicles</h2>
        <p>
          Keep track of your whole household fleet with ease:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dashboard view:</strong> See all vehicles and their upcoming maintenance at a glance</li>
          <li><strong>Shared access:</strong> Allow family members to view and log service for shared vehicles</li>
          <li><strong>Vehicle groups:</strong> Organize by driver, vehicle type, or any custom category</li>
          <li><strong>Comparison reports:</strong> See which vehicles cost the most to maintain</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Tips & Best Practices -->
      <section class="guide-section">
        <h2>Tips & Best Practices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Log everything immediately:</strong> Add service records right after maintenance
            while details are fresh. Keep receipts in your glove box to enter later if needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Take photos:</strong> Snap pics of receipts, damaged parts, or work in progress.
            These are invaluable for warranty claims and insurance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Track fuel economy:</strong> Log fill-ups to monitor MPG trends. Sudden drops
            can indicate maintenance issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use consistent shop names:</strong> If you visit "Joe's Auto," always enter it
            the same way for easier filtering and reporting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Add modifications:</strong> Log upgrades and aftermarket parts. This helps with
            resale and insurance documentation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Set conservative reminders:</strong> Better to get reminded a bit early than to
            miss important service by waiting too long.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Troubleshooting -->
      <section class="guide-section">
        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <h3>Not receiving reminders?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Check that notifications are enabled in your device settings</li>
          <li>Verify reminder settings in the vehicle profile</li>
          <li>Ensure you've entered current mileage accurately</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Need to edit a past entry?</h3>
        <p>
          Tap any service record to view details, then select "Edit" to make changes or "Delete"
          to remove it entirely.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Lost receipts?</h3>
        <p>
          Most shops can provide duplicate receipts or email copies. Add them to your records
          as soon as you get them!
