        Welcome! Stock Hammer is a straightforward inventory and sales management tool designed specifically
        for small businesses, makers, and shops. Unlike complicated systems, Stock Hammer focuses on what
        you actually need: fast inventory tracking, simple sales processing, and useful reports—without
        the overwhelming features or steep learning curve.
      </p>

      <!-- Getting Started -->
      <section class="guide-section">
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
          Set up your inventory system in minutes, not hours:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Create your account:</strong> Sign up and create your business profile</li>
          <li><strong>Add your products:</strong> Start with your most popular items and build from there</li>
          <li><strong>Set inventory levels:</strong> Enter current stock quantities</li>
          <li><strong>Configure pricing:</strong> Set retail prices, cost, and any variants (sizes, colors, etc.)</li>
          <li><strong>Start selling:</strong> Process your first sale and watch inventory update automatically</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Don't try to add everything at once. Start with your best-sellers
          and add more products as you go. You'll be up and running faster this way.

      <!-- Tips & Best Practices -->
      <section class="guide-section">
        <h2>Tips & Best Practices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Do regular inventory counts:</strong> Count physical stock monthly or quarterly
            and adjust in the system. This catches shrinkage, damage, or errors.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Set realistic reorder points:</strong> Consider lead time from suppliers.
            If it takes 2 weeks to restock, set alerts to trigger with 3 weeks of inventory left.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use SKUs consistently:</strong> Create a simple SKU system and stick to it.
            This makes scanning, searching, and reporting much easier.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Track your costs accurately:</strong> Update product costs when supplier prices
            change. This keeps your profit margin reports accurate.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Review reports weekly:</strong> Spend 15 minutes each week looking at your
            best sellers and slow movers. This helps you make smart buying decisions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Train your staff:</strong> Make sure everyone who processes sales knows how
            to use Stock Hammer. It's designed to be intuitive, but a quick training session helps.
          </li>
          <li>
     <!--       <strong>Keep notes:</strong> Use the notes field for products to track supplier info,
            seasonal notes, or customer feedback.   -->
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Troubleshooting -->
      <section class="guide-section">
        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <h3>Inventory count doesn't match physical stock?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Check recent sales and returns for errors</li>
          <li>Review manual adjustments in the history</li>
          <li>Do a physical count and use "Adjust Inventory" to correct</li>
          <li>Add a note explaining the discrepancy for your records</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Barcode scanner not working?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Make sure it's connected and powered on</li>
          <li>Try scanning a product barcode—it should appear in the search field</li>
          <li>Check that the cursor is in the search box before scanning</li>
          <li>Some scanners need to be configured—check the scanner's manual</li>
        </ul>
        
    <!--    <h3>Need to void a sale?</h3>
        <p>
          Find the sale in sales history, click "Void Sale," and confirm. Inventory will
          automatically be returned to stock.
        </p>    
        
        <h3>Accidentally deleted a product?</h3>
        <p>
          Contact support immediately—we may be able to restore it from backups. In the future,
          consider using "Archive" instead of "Delete" for products you no longer sell.
