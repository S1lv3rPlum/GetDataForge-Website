        Welcome to the Filament Foundry guide! Learn how to track your 3D printing filament inventory,
        monitor usage, and reduce waste across your projects.
      </p>

      <!-- Getting Started -->
      <section class="guide-section">
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
          Filament Foundry helps you keep track of all your 3D printing materials in one place.
          Whether you're managing a small personal collection or a larger inventory for a business,
          this app makes it easy to know what you have, what you've used, and when to restock.
        </p>
        <h3>Key Features:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Track filament types, colors, and quantities</li>
          <li>Log completed and failed prints</li>
          <li>Monitor material usage over time</li>
          <li>Get alerts when spools run low</li>
          <li>Organize by brand, type, and color</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Adding Filament -->
      <section class="guide-section">
        <h2>Adding Filament to Your Inventory</h2>
        <p>
          Start by adding all your filament spools to the app. For each spool, you'll record:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Brand:</strong> Manufacturer name (e.g., Hatchbox, eSun, Overture)</li>
          <li><strong>Type:</strong> Material type (PLA, PETG, ABS, TPU, etc.)</li>
          <li><strong>Color:</strong> Color name or description</li>
          <li><strong>Weight:</strong> Initial weight in grams</li>
 <!--         <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Price per spool (optional, helps with budget tracking)</li>   -->
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Weigh your spools including the spool core itself when you first add them.
          This gives you a baseline to track usage accurately.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Tracking Usage -->
      <section class="guide-section">
        <h2>Tracking Print Usage</h2>
        <p>
          After each print job, log your usage to keep your inventory accurate:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Select the spool you used from your inventory</li>
          <li>Enter the weight used (or weigh the spool again to calculate)</li>
          <li>Add print details: project name</li>  <!--add notes ? -->
          <li>Save the entry</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The app will automatically update your remaining filament weight and show you how much
          you've used over time.
        </p>
        <h3>Failed Prints:</h3>
        <p>
          Don't forget to log failed prints too! This helps you track wasted material and
          identify problem filaments or settings. Mark prints as "failed" 
        </p>  <!-- and add notes
          about what went wrong. -->
      </section>

      <!-- Managing Inventory -->
<!--      <section class="guide-section">
        <h2>Managing Your Inventory</h2>
        <p>
          Keep your filament collection organized with these features:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Search & Filter:</strong> Find spools by type, color, or brand quickly</li> 
          <li><strong>Low Stock Alerts:</strong> Set weight thresholds to get notified when spools run low</li>
          <li><strong>Archive Empty Spools:</strong> Move finished spools to archive to keep your active inventory clean</li>
          <li><strong>Sort Options:</strong> Organize by date added, remaining weight, or last used</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Best Practice:</strong> Review your inventory monthly and archive any spools
          you've fully used. This keeps your active list manageable.
        </p>

      <!-- Reports & Insights -->
      <section class="guide-section">
        <h2>Reports & Insights</h2>
        <p>
          Use Filament Foundry's reporting features to understand your printing patterns:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Usage by Type:</strong> See which materials you use most often</li>
          <li><strong>Cost Analysis:</strong> Track how much you're spending on filament</li>
          <li><strong>Success Rate:</strong> Monitor your print success vs. failure ratio</li>
          <li><strong>Monthly Trends:</strong> View usage patterns over time</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These insights help you make smarter purchasing decisions and optimize your printing workflow.

      <!-- Tips & Best Practices -->
      <section class="guide-section">
        <h2>Tips & Best Practices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Weigh regularly:</strong> Re-weigh spools every few prints to ensure accuracy.
            Small errors compound over time.
          </li>
          <li>
     <!--       <strong>Add notes:</strong> Record print settings, nozzle temperature, and any issues.
            This creates a valuable reference for future prints.  -->
          </li>
          <li>
      <!--      <strong>Set reorder points:</strong> Don't wait until you're completely out! Set alerts
            at 200-300g remaining so you have time to restock. -->
          </li>
          <li>
 <!--           <strong>Track storage conditions:</strong> Note where each spool is stored (dry box,
            shelf, etc.) to monitor humidity exposure.  -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Color consistency:</strong> Use consistent color naming (e.g., "Red" vs "Crimson")
            to make searching easier.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Troubleshooting -->
      <section class="guide-section">
        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <h3>Inventory doesn't match reality?</h3>
        <p>
          If your recorded amounts don't match your physical spools, try these steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Re-weigh all active spools and update them manually</li>
          <li>Check that you're including spool core weight in your measurements</li>
          <li>Review recent print logs for any missed entries</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Need to adjust a past entry?</h3>
        <p>
          You can edit or delete previous print logs from the usage history. Just tap the entry
          and select "Edit" or "Delete" from the menu.
        </p>
