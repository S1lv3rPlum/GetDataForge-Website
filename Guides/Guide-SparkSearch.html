        <h2>Tips for Parents</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Search together at first:</strong> Spend time using Spark Search with your child
            to teach them how to search safely and respectfully.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Review search history regularly:</strong> Check weekly to understand your child's
            interests and ensure they're using the app appropriately.
          </li>

            <strong>Encourage creativity:</strong> Use the coloring feature to turn screen time into
            creative time!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Update banned words:</strong> As your child grows and their vocabulary expands,
            review and update your banned word list.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use it as a learning tool:</strong> When your child searches for something, use it
            as a conversation starter about that topic.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Set clear boundaries:</strong> Establish rules about when and how long they can use
            Spark Search, just like any other screen time.
